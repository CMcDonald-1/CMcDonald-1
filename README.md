- 👋 Hi, I’m @CMcDonald-1, and PhD Student in the Yale Statistics and Data Science Department
- 👀 I’m interested in sampling problems in statistics, particularly sampling difficult distributions such as multi-modal densities. I research various markov chain 
monte carlo methods, score based generative modeling, optimal transport, and stochastic diffusion towards this end. I'd like to apply these sampling methods to Bayesian 
inference, generative modeling, and non-convex optimization problems. Closely related are algorithms for random optimization
or random search algorithms, which can be viewed in a similar lens to a sampling problem. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the PyTorch library, recent advances in stable diffusion, and MCMC with STAN.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects in generative models, Bayesian inference, non-parametric modeling, and stochastic methods for non-convex optimization.
- 📫 How to reach me, curtis.mcdonald@yale.edu
